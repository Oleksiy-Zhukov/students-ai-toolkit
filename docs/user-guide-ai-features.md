## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"I don't see AI suggestions"**
- Make sure you're on http://localhost:5173/study (not just http://localhost:5173)
- After creating/editing a note, click the 🧠 **"AI Analysis"** button
- The AI panel will appear below the note editor

### **"My notes aren't connecting automatically"**
- Connections are suggestions, not automatic
- Click 🧠 **"AI Analysis"** to see connection suggestions
- Click 🔗 **"Auto-Connect"** to create the suggested connections
- Similar content needs sufficient keyword overlap to connect

### **"Connection generation seems weak"**
The current system uses TF-IDF similarity. For better connections:
- Use specific, descriptive keywords in your notes
- Include clear relationships in content (e.g., "builds upon", "prerequisite")
- Add relevant tags to help categorization
