[studentsai.org](https://www.studentsai.org/)

## About

A modern, open-source AI-powered study assistant designed to help students learn faster and smarter. Summarize readings, generate questions, and build study plans‚Äîall from your documents or text input.

This project serves a dual purpose: it's a powerful productivity tool for students and a comprehensive portfolio piece showcasing full-stack development, AI integration, and robust deployment strategies across modern platforms.

### Goals

**For Students:** To provide a clean, intuitive, and practical AI toolset that enhances the studying experience.

**For Developers:** To demonstrate proficiency in cutting-edge technologies including React, FastAPI, OpenAI, and effective deployment practices.

## Project Status

*   **Deployed & Functional:** Live and ready for use.
*   **Actively Maintained:** Continuously improved with new features and optimizations.
*   **Secure & Reliable:** Features like reCAPTCHA v3 and rate limiting ensure a secure and smooth user experience.

## Architecture

### Frontend

A component-based React Single Page Application (SPA) featuring intuitive modules like `FileUploader`, `ActionSelector`, and `ResultsDisplay`. It leverages React hooks and `fetch` for seamless communication with the backend.

### Backend

A modular FastAPI application structured for scalability and maintainability:

*   `main.py`: The application's entry point, defining routes and middleware.
*   `ai_backends.py`: Abstracts AI service integration, supporting both OpenAI and Hugging Face.
*   `file_processor.py`: Handles parsing of `.pdf`, `.txt`, and `.docx` file formats.
*   `models.py`: Defines input/output schemas using Pydantic for robust data validation.
*   `config.py`: Manages environment-driven configurations.

For a detailed architectural breakdown, refer to the [Architecture Document](docs/architecture.md).

## Features

*   **Versatile Content Input:** Upload and parse `.pdf`, `.txt`, or `.docx` files, or paste text directly.
*   **AI-Powered Learning Tools:** Summarize content, generate insightful questions, and create personalized study plans.
*   **Export & Share:** Easily export results or copy them to your clipboard.
*   **Mobile-Responsive:** Optimized for a seamless experience across all devices.
*   **Swappable AI Backends:** Flexibility to choose between OpenAI and Hugging Face for AI processing.

## Local Setup

To get the Student AI Toolkit running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js v18+ (with npm or pnpm)
*   Python 3.11+
*   API keys for:
    *   OpenAI and/or Hugging Face
    *   Google reCAPTCHA v3

### Installation (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oleksiy-Zhukov/students-ai-toolkit.git
cd students-ai-toolkit
```

#### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

**Example `.env` values:**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=hf_...
AI_BACKEND=openai
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=...
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=...
DEBUG=True
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
```

#### Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd ../frontend/student-ai-toolkit-frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend && python main.py
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend/student-ai-toolkit-frontend && npm run dev
