## 🎛️ Configuration

### Animation Settings

The animation system can be configured through environment variables and component props:

```javascript
// Disable animations globally
REACT_APP_DISABLE_ANIMATIONS=true

// Reduce animation intensity
REACT_APP_ANIMATION_INTENSITY=low

// Enable debug mode
REACT_APP_DEBUG_ANIMATIONS=true
```

### Component Configuration

```jsx
// Configure animation delays and intensity
<AnimatedCard delay={0.2} enableHover={true}>
  Content
</AnimatedCard>

// Control animation variants
<motion.div variants={customVariants} initial="initial" animate="animate">
  Custom animated content
</motion.div>
```

---

## ♿ Accessibility

### Reduced Motion Support

The enhanced frontend includes comprehensive support for users with motion sensitivity:

- Automatic detection of `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting
- Alternative experiences that maintain functionality without motion
- Configurable animation intensity levels
- Instant state changes for critical interactions

### Screen Reader Compatibility

- Proper ARIA labels and live regions for animation states
- Focus management during transitions
- Content accessibility throughout animation sequences
- Loading state announcements

### Keyboard Navigation

- Animation-aware focus management
- Visible focus indicators during animations
- Proper tab order maintenance
- Skip links and navigation aids

---

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Animations

1. **Define Animation Variants** in `src/animations/variants.js`
2. **Create Enhanced Components** in `src/components/animated/`
3. **Use Custom Hooks** from `src/hooks/useAnimations.js`
4. **Test Accessibility** with reduced motion and screen readers

### Performance Guidelines

- Use `transform` and `opacity` for smooth animations
- Implement proper cleanup in custom hooks
- Test on various devices and browsers
- Monitor frame rates and memory usage

### Testing Animations

```bash
# Run tests with animation support
npm test

# Test accessibility compliance
npm run test:a11y

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance
```

---

## 📦 Build and Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze
```

### Deployment Options

**Static Hosting** (Recommended)
- Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
- Automatic optimization and CDN distribution
- Environment variable support

**Traditional Web Servers**
- Apache, Nginx, or IIS
- Serve from `dist/` directory after build
- Configure proper MIME types for assets

### Performance Optimization

- Tree-shaking eliminates unused animation code
- Code splitting for animation-heavy components
- Asset optimization and compression
- CDN integration for animation libraries

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Animations Not Working**
- Check browser compatibility (requires modern browser)
- Verify Framer Motion installation
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce animation complexity
- Enable hardware acceleration
- Check for memory leaks in custom hooks

**Accessibility Problems**

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see animation states and performance metrics:

```javascript
// Add to .env.local
REACT_APP_DEBUG_ANIMATIONS=true
```
